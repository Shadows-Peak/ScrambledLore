The purest form of controlled magics, being the careful weaving of many threads of [[Chaos]] into a pure source of magic with easy usage. The weaves interlocked in different manners, allowing for different forms of magic to take root by varying the amounts of which thread clusters you used from the pure magic form.



### Vessel-Bound Magic
One manner through which magic can be channeled is by using a scientific device to allow those with more difficulty in using magic to be able to take advantage of whatever lies within them, typically their [[Affinity]]. This magic is a type of support that allows the magic of the wearer to take fruition, and often means their magic can only be as strong as the device through which it is channeled by. There is also the added weakness that you are no longer able to utilize this magic if the device is harmed or can no longer run.
