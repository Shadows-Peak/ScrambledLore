The most untainted magic, but also the most unpredictable. It is capable of anything, as it is forged from and utilizes [[Chaos]]. The more Chaos energy you utilize, the more you can accomplish, but without proper control things could go very wrong. With enough Chaos energy that embodies you, or if you were just born with proper control like in the cases of entities like [[Aternos]], then you can begin to control the Chaos Magic more properly, but that weakens it greatly in turn.

Chaos Magic is generally inaccessible to any and all creatures born after the [[Unification of Magic]], save the [[Prodigy|Prodigies]]. This is because Chaos energy is only used to form a newly born creature, but then it is unified after that point. Chaos is only used in the initial exchanges, it is no longer a final product to anything other than [[Chaos Dragons]] and the Prodigies.

### Effects on Time
Think of Chaos as a flowing river; you can see where it is flowing from and mentally rewind it to see how things came to be, but you cannot reverse the flow of this river. You can easily look to the farther end of the river, maybe swim downstream and make a ruckus, but you cannot swim upstream for the current is too strong. In this way, Chaos Magic cannot affect the past, it can only view the past. However, you could easily affect the future. Time and Chaos, just like space and time, are interwoven and this rule cannot be violated.
