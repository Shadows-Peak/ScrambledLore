## Story
**Xavier:** ==Ovus?==
*She nods*
**Xavier:** ==That hardly seems the name of a woman.==
*Her eyes look down*
**Xavier:** ==Oh well wait—no. I didn’t mean it that way, I just thought..==
*A moment of silence passes*
**Ovus:** ==Listen..  You’re not meant to talk to me.==
*Xavier stares past her obscured face for a moment before looking forward and leaning into the bench*
**Xavier:** ==Listen lady; the other people here are kinda old and you seem to be about my age. Not only that but you actually seem to hold quite the [[Affinity]].==
*Ovus’ eyes widen as she looks up at Xavier*
**Ovus:** ==How do you know that?..== *She sits up slightly* ==Don’t tell anyone.. They might.. hurt me.== *Shes looking out ahead, not really focusing on any particular thing*
**Xavier:** *Laughs* ==These guys are supposed to be scholars, right?== *He looks to Ovus, awaiting a response*
*She nods*
**Xavier:** ==Well there you have it, they’re completely and utterly useless.== *He points at one of the noblemen across the room where there is a conversation being held*
**Xavier:** ==That guy alone, he wouldn’t be able to lift a single finger against you.==
*Ovus turns back to face Xavier*
**Ovus:** ==Who are you anyway?== *She looks him up and down for a moment* ==Are you a noble or not?==
*Xavier’s expression hardens as his eyes drift towards the nobleman wearing perhaps the most extravagant clothing*
**Xavier:** ==Uh well, my father—adopted, you see—has taken quite the liking to mages.== *He turns to face Ovus* ==..Of which of course, I am.== *He extends his finger forward slightly and creates a small fire on the tip of his finger*
*Ovus’ eyes widen and she looks down at her own hand for a moment*
**Xavier:** ==You can do it too.== *He shifts closer* ==I can tell. You’re just like me.==
*She suddenly looks up at him and shifts away*
**Ovus:** ==I am no nobleman’s slave.==
**Xavier:** ==I simply said I was adopted.==
**Ovus:** ==We are—as you previously noted—the same age. Do you take me for a fool, slave boy?==
*Xavier begins to grin*
**Xavier:** ==Slave boy, huh?== *He contemplates telling her his real name for a moment before leaning in closer by a little* ==Fine, I may not receive the liberties I’d want..==
*She sees his grin and she allows her shoulders to relax slightly*
**Ovus:** ==A slave—a tool even.== *She begins to grin back* ==Though I suppose a useful one?==
*Xavier looks out towards his master for a moment before looking back*
**Xavier:** ==Am I useful enough to warrant a purchase from one hand to another is the real question?==
*Ovus raises her eyebrows before playfully furrowing them and smirking*
**Ovus:** ==Are you asking me to buy you, slave boy?==
**Xavier:** ==What an interesting idea, Ovus. You know I took you for the shy and quiet type just a moment ago.. Who would’ve thought..==
*She looks out into the crowd to make sure no one is looking before leaning in slightly*
**Ovus:** ==If we took you in, would you teach me that fire trick?==
*Xavier grinned once more*
**Xavier:** ==That and much more.==
*She smiled a bit before it fell from her face and she returned to how she had been sitting with a slightly solemn expression*
**Ovus:** ==Your name, slave boy.==
*Xavier looked at her with a slightly confusion before replying*
**Xavier:** ==Xavier, at your service.==
**Ovus:** ==Xavier..== *She repeated as if she was testing the name on her tongue* ==As in the same Xavier that was apart of 5 selected for the determination of the [[Prodigy|prodigy’s]] reincarnation?==
*His eyebrows slightly raised*
**Xavier:** ==U-Uh yes—though that was quite some time ago now.==
**Ovus:** ==It was only 11 years ago.. And those kids were how old?== *She grinned* ==About 6 right? Making you..== *Xavier sighed* ==Well well slave boy.. Did you same ‘same age?’==
*He looks away guilty*
**Xavier:** ==You’re only 2 years older, what’s it matter?==
*She shifts closer*
**Ovus:** ==Aw poor child. Maybe they don’t teach servants quite the same, but women don’t go younger.== *She leans closer* ==Especially not the royals.==
*Xavier slowly turns to look back at her, nervously*
**Xavier:** ==Who said anything about going after someone?==
*She grins wider*
**Ovus:** ==Your voice is shaking, slave boy==
*Ovus stands up suddenly*
**Ovus:** ==You’ll hear from me.== *She starts walking away* ==Or you won’t, who knows?==
*Xavier watches as she walks away, before slowly lowering his vision onto the floor in front of him, then raising it to his master with a small lump in his throat*
**Xavier:** ==Slave boy?..== *He grits his teeth slightly as he stands up and walks over to his master*
**Sango:** *His eyes trail away from who he’s talking to as he spots Xavier approaching* ==—Ah! A-And this is the one I had been telling you of!== *He grabs Xavier’s sleeve and pulls him in* ==This is Xavier—he was one of those possible prodigies or whatever—but he’s quite the exceptional mage you’ll find.==
*Sango is questioned by another nobleman about why someone who reeked of the commoner’s filth was brought into their hall*
**Sango:** *Sango laughs* ==So you can still smell him, ‘ey?== *He roughly pats Xavier’s back* ==No, this one is so much more than that you see.== *He points to the fireplace* ==Xavier boy, put that out for a moment.==
*Some of the other noblemen look one skeptically as Xavier rolls his eyes at what is a rather easy request. Nevertheless, as he performs the feat, the noblemen look on with awe at the rather unremarkable action that had just took place*
**Sango:** ==A-and back on now!==
*With another moment of annoyed obedience, Xavier relights the fireplace from across the room*
**Sango:** *Sango leans in towards the noblemen, but doesn’t make too great an attempt to lower his voice* ==Now listen here, the boys for sale if you want a mage. He was simply too expensive to get the proper mentors and equipment.. Now that he’s on the other end of it; I realize it’s somewhat like flipping something.== *He pulls out a bank note of sorts* ==Tell you what, I’ll even give you a small discount on him.==
*Xavier steps back from the commotion with a silent resignation, realizing that Ovus won’t even be able to purchase him into their family at this point. After a moment, he looks around to see if he can spot her. What he finds, however, is her father making the purchase with Sango*
**Sango:** *He snorts and laughs as he attempts to speak* ==S-S-Sold!== *He enthusiastically extends his hand for a firm handshake, and after it concluded he continues* ==That was more than enough! Take him today for all I care!==

*Time presses on, and after the party Sango tells Xavier to not make him look bad and takes his leave alongside many other noblemen until it remains just Ovus’ father*

**Ovo:** ==Come here, boy.== *He looks at Xavier directly as he addresses him*
*Xavier hesitantly walks over*
**Ovo:** ==For a reason—that lies beyond me—my daughter wished for me to take the initiative upon your purchase.== *He looks out the window for a moment* ==Just.. Don’t cause trouble, and don’t touch my daughter.== *He points to a maid that had just walked in through a door* ==She will take you to a small room. Behave yourself in there for the night until we make decision on your purpose.==
*Xavier bowed before the man and followed his orders, arriving at a small room*
*His eyes looked across its simple form, taking in it’s beauty that it held even in the most basic of constructions*
**Xavier:** ==At least I’m no slave to a poor man.==
*Taking a moment to settle down, Xavier senses that truly no one is coming for him at this time of the night, and decides to settle in for rest*

*Xavier awakes to a shaking that rocks his entire body. Upon focusing his eyes he can discern the form of Ovus looming over him.*
**Ovus:** ==Come on, wake up! What was the point in buying you if you don’t even do what I say?== *She continues relentlessly shaking Xavier*
**Xavier:** ==S-stop it! I’m awake!== *He attempts to swat her off him*
**Ovus:** *She groans* ==Finally. Now come on, we don’t have much time.== *She grabs Xavier’s wrist and tries to pull him up*
**Xavier:** ==I said stop it! And what do you mean hurry up?==
*She looked down at Xavier as if it was obvious*
**Ovus:** ==We’re running away, slave boy.==
*Xavier’s eyes shoot up in surprise after a moment of processing and he sits up slowly*
**Xavier:** ==Are you being serious?==
*She tugs on his wrist again, seemingly impatient as she looks back at the door she entered from*
**Ovus:** ==No time for questions. Are you coming or not?== *She looks him straight in the face*
*Xavier stutters for a moment, looking around at the room he’s in*
**Xavier:** ==Y-yeah of course.==
*Ovus grins and yanks him up off the bed with one final tug*
**Ovus:** ==Good slave. Now come on, behind me.==
**Xavier:** *He hobbles up off the floor and runs after her* ==I’d appreciate it though if you recall my name more properly==
*The come to a turn down a long hallway where Ovus looks both ways before confidently continuing down the left side*
**Ovus:** ==This way, slave boy==
*Xavier sighs defeated as he follows along.*
*They come across a window where Ovus signals him through before following herself. On the other end they find themselves outside.*
**Ovus:** ==No turning back now. You either run away a free man, or come with me and teach me your [[Magic|magic]]==
*Xavier grins*
**Xavier:** ==You have too much potential for me to pass this up.==
**Ovus:** *Her brows raise playfully* ==Oh is that why?== *She starts running along*
**Xavier:** *Sighs* ==What the hell am I doing?==
*Xavier runs after Ovus, maintaining a pace behind her and assuming a protective position ensuring that no one gets too close*

*The few times he did detect hostile on their journey, he would obliterate them before Ovus could even become aware of them, but Xavier did not tell her this fact*

*They would live somewhat nomadically, where on occasion Xavier would dedicate time to teach her fundamentals, and eventually something greater*
