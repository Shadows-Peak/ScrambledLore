The stampede of horses was heard over the horizon. "They're here," I thought. Perhaps this is no time to act as if my life is some story book though, for the [[Syndicate of Wraiths]] is upon us. We frantically took to weaponry, but [[Wraiths|wraiths]] are no ordinary creatures. To damage a wraith, one must use some form [[Magic]] or some form of [[Enchanting|magically augmented weaponry]]. I have been in the works on a [[Homunculus]] for quite some time now, but I fear they are not yet ready for the world. I'd like to tweak some of their memories, you see. I fear that if I released them now they may turn out a little more hot-headed then I'd like for a future companion. Ever since I discovered I had a cycle of rebirth due to my [[Tho-Dragun|lineage]] I have desired to make a creature capable of identifying me regardless of my possession of a new [[Soul|soul]] and form and to remind me of who I truly am. I suppose I don't have much a choice however, so I suppose today I unveil him. My fire-slinging dad-bod of awesomeness and eternal stability-[[Firelash]].
