### Past/Future Time Interactions of Chaos:
- You can easily cast back magic along flow of chaos and time to feel out the events that previously happened, but it is surface level and can’t be touched
- You can cast magic forward but it is hard to reel back, and is better for making one change without even really seeing what’s happening in the future 
- If you get data on the past and present, once could reasonably use the flow of chaos and time to predict the future, but not perfectly see it, this is due to the disruptions that may occur in the future that you cannot perfectly account for

### Religion/Mythology Belief Notes For World-building:
- Need mythology that isn’t true so as to not violate the rulings of a developing/developed social world
- There may be true things these mythology derive from line with krakens in our world or various artifacts
- There mythologies aren’t really to be used rather than the initial write, maybe the society that coined its, or perhaps if it’s a motivation like hitler in our real world looking for artifacts
- Consider the level of impact the gods have in the world and their prevalence (are they constantly present within the mortal world?)
- Determine if atheism is more logical or fanatic based of the previous bullet point, then whether or not agnosticism can exist
- Are there faux religions and faux addendums to real religions? How much evidence is there to the people that these religions are real?



Age of fatigue -> Era of the Prodigy


Nations at the end of the world would likely fight constantly as those nations get first dibs on the land that is created there and so the nations would want to compete over the rights for this land to grow with.


Maybe Legyre starts liking boat warfare and stuff as a result of the Ring wars and so he sets it up to disrupt the flow of chaos around the anomaly ever so often so that water is generated farther out.

Keepers of Halüges were first formed as a scholar encountered Grandun and after some conversation eventually asked to see the greatest and most magnificent thing in the universe. Grandun grinned and guffawed. He thought it incredibly interesting that a simple creature like him would look upon Grandun’s form and still desire to see something even greater. He told him: “I like you.” And teleported him to a corner of the universe where Kupaulus was hiding. The sight chilled the mortal to his bones, but Kupaulus, despite originally being upset, saw purpose in the visit. He imparted upon the mortal a word, “Halüges” and he told him: “That will be your role.” In the next moment, the mortal was struck with much of the knowledge that Kupaulus held, sending the mortal into a form of shock that he would never quite recover from. Kupaulus returned the mortal to Navu, who now would periodically turn catatonic in moments of stress. Regardless, he would move forward and collect more scholars that were interested in dragons, trying to tell them the truth he had been given. Not everything he said was taken seriously, but he kept trying anyways. Above all this, he wrote down on tablets what he had been shown. With Kupaulus’ knowledge, he also went to go find Vokzan, seeing if Vokzan could piece together a way to get people to take him seriously. Vokzan informs him that it should already be obvious, a pact must be made with a dragon, and that he already knows who. Though confused by this at first, he came to realize that only one dragon may lend the needed show of power to a mere mortal, Grandun. He dedicated the rest of his life to finding Grandun again, spreading his knowledge as he went. Eventually, he found Grandun again and convinced him to make the deal. Returning to many of the scholars, he now was able to show them that the dragons truly had faith in him, and the people began to trust in him, and worship him too. They believed this man to be a great dragon reborn into the body of man (they did not know of tho dragons either). This caused the keepers of halüges to be somewhat of a cult for a while before fully developing into a religion. The tables they had wrote served as a base alongside accounts of what he had done in his life by other people.
