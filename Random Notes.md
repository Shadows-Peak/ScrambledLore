### Past/Future Time Interactions of Chaos:
- You can easily cast back magic along flow of chaos and time to feel out the events that previously happened, but it is surface level and can’t be touched
- You can cast magic forward but it is hard to reel back, and is better for making one change without even really seeing what’s happening in the future 
- If you get data on the past and present, once could reasonably use the flow of chaos and time to predict the future, but not perfectly see it

### Religion/Mythology Belief Notes For World-building:
- Need mythology that isn’t true so as to not violate the rulings of a developing/developed social world
- There may be true things these mythology derive from line with krakens in our world or various artifacts
- There mythologies aren’t really to be used rather than the initial write, maybe the society that coined its, or perhaps if it’s a motivation like hitler in our real world looking for artifacts
- Consider the level of impact the gods have in the world and their prevalence (are they constantly present within the mortal world?)
- Determine if atheism is more logical or fanatic based of the previous bullet point, then whether or not agnosticism can exist
- Are there faux religions and faux addendums to real religions? How much evidence is there to the people that these religions are real?

Nations at the end of the world would likely fight constantly as those nations get first dibs on the land that is created there and so the nations would want to compete over the rights for this land to grow with.
