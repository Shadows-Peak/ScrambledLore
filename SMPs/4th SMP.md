### Original SMP Notes
This SMP was very involved on the side of having gimmicks. This is the first one to feature something as changing as a magic mod, and it revolved heavily around that when referring to its gimmicks. All of these changes are shown below:

![[Mox's Sheet.webp]]![[Chillest's Sheet.webp]]![[Destroyer's Sheet.webp]]![[Link's Sheet.webp]]![[Orange's Sheet.webp]]![[Rain's Sheet.webp]]![[Blu's Sheet.webp]]![[Glitch's Sheet.webp]]![[Game's Sheet.webp]]![[Vebe's Sheet.webp]]![[Duckebo's Sheet.webp]]![[Purple's Sheet.webp]]![[Poke's Sheet.webp]]

These gimmicks were paired with only being able to form teams of players with the following ruling:

Point Values (10 points max on a team): 
7 - Ali 
6 - Ryken 
5 - Ryker 
4 - Skyler 
4 - Blu 
3 - Kai 
3 - Aidan
3 - Isaac 
3 - Chase 
2 - Kiley 
2 - Via 
2 - Game 
2 - Kian

These values were based off a combo of knowing tech mods, being good at pvp, and just being good at minecraft in general.

### In the sake of current lore
Much like all the other times that [[Humans]] were tempted by [[The Egg]], but this happened as [[Magic]] was coming back. Many [[Dragons]] were fostered by these Humans too, but The Egg was still not acquired by this group, making it more of a side story.
