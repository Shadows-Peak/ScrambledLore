### Original SMP Notes
This SMP was similar to the 1st in the sense that it did not conclude at any late game point. The dragon egg was not obtained, and mostly only overworld progress was made. Similar to the first time, there were factions, but this time mostly only 2-3. There was also a lore document dating back to this point in time, however its lore focuses on more than just dragons being the original species and implies some things ruled different parts of the world with the dragon just happening to be the strongest of them. Here is an attached map that was made during the time we must have played:

### In the sake of current lore
For the sake of current lore, we will now consider this in much the same way we consider the first. This was just a group of [[Humans]] who had heard some legends of [[The Egg]] but in the end were more concerned about their own lives and building their relations and nations than partaking in [[Prodigy Child (Probot)|He Who Watches]]' game. This is yet another side story.
