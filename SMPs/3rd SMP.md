### Original SMP Notes
There was a huge tech mod focus by a majority of the players that got powerful. Additionally, this was the longest lasting of any of the 4 SMPs that have been done. There were many mod changes made throughout its run time, and small bouts of admin abuse. Many of the bases were found along a river that ran from the ocean to a forest and into a mesa. Some others were located on the middle of the ocean and on a plateau in the mountains. There was also a base far away on a mushroom island. There was no real gimmick but there were attempts at lore and roleplay. Specifically, when the egg was obtained it was the goal of some other members to obtain it for themselves.

### In the sake of current lore
This was a successful group of [[Humans]] that actually had acquired [[The Egg]] for themselves. Not only that, but there was significant restoration of infrastructure and technology within the area that this took place in. If it weren't for the nuclear explosions and reactor breakdowns in the area, this could have eventually grown into a well-to-do establishment of humanity. This was the most appeasing course of events for [[Prodigy Child (Probot)|He Who Watches]] to watch.
