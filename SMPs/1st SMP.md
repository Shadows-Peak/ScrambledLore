### Original SMP Notes
In the 1st SMP done under the Scrambled SMP, the lore was a little different given that it said Dragons terrorized people and pillagers fought back sending them to the End. However, in this iteration the egg was still meant to be a source of power, this will be how it is adapted into our current lore. This was non-modded and we each chose faction names to operate our bases from. There was also supposedly a gimmick on the server being: "The dragon egg could be turned to shards that made things Unbreakable."

### In the sake of current lore
We will consider the events of the 1st SMP as an area of the world where there was a group of [[Humans]] curious about [[The Egg]]. However, as I don't recall it ever even getting close to obtaining the egg, these people will have eventually grown tired of their goal and have given up. This means the events of the 1st SMP were more akin to a side story, with slight progress being made, but overall the Humans did not succumb to [[Prodigy Child (Probot)|He Who Watches]]' games.
