### Details

* Johnathon Monébaggs helps out Sin during a visit to Medrum to flaunt his wealth and even donate it to the nations there, as he believes Medrum has the right to live where they want to live, as it reminds him of his father living his own life despite all he had. In this visit, he goes to Sin seeing them as the apex of Medrum. He offers them help to destroy their greatest rival. Sin says that Naze is perhaps the most formidable force across the sea, and if they were able to eliminate them then Medrum may be truly seen as a powerhouse that should be left alone.
