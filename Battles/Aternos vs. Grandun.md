A fight held over differing interests deciding the fate over the existence of other life forms 

### Information
**Location**: Above [[Navu#Medrum|Medrum]]
**Date:** 308 years after the [[Unification of Magic]]
**Involved Parties**: [[Aternos]], [[Grandun, the Great Dragon|Grandun]]
**Result:** Grandun’s victory and Navu was spared

### Details
After the Unification of Magic, Aternos eventually learned of the existence of the [[Anomaly]], which likely existed as a direct result of such a powerful spell being performed (as Chaos is prone to random effects being caused too, no matter the caution). Upon learning of its existence, Aternos seeks to destroy it. However, Grandun—seeing the potential worth of a world forming in a more stable existence given that [[Magic]] now permeates the world—argues for the case of keeping it there. In response, Aternos snaps at Grandun, firmly believing that their world was created for dragons and dragons alone. Grandun tells Aternos to stand down, reminding Aternos that he himself holds more power than him as an original dragon. Aternos, still cocky from the heights of power he has achieved, swings a claw at Grandun—who slithers out of the way. This causes Grandun to say:

> (In [[Dragon Tongue]]) “A child. That is all you are. I pity the reflection through which you gaze upon. The vessel that praises itself. Rebellious teen who dares talk back. We don’t care for the young as attentively as we should, I can tell. Don’t pass as many stories as we should, this much is obvious”
> 
> — Grandun, reminding Aternos he’s him

Immediately proceeding this, Grandun fires a laser from his mouth and clips one of Aternos’ wings, who now has to expend energy to regenerate the lost limb. The battle continues, revealing Aternos is extremely outmatched, though it is worth nothing that 308 years isn’t much time in terms of recovering from the casting of a spell as giant as the Unification of Magic. Aternos does manage to wound Grandun multiple times, but Grandun consistently causes huge damage to Aternos that he has to deliberately expend energy to heal against. As a result, Aternos calls off their duel and agrees not to touch the Anomaly or anything that grows from it again.
