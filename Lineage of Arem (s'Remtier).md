the s'Remtier line goes back to the [[unification of magic]]. [[Arem]] was a [[dragon]] that in fear of being eradicated as a part of the 20% of dragons who died, was forced to quantum-hibernate and eons later reawake as a human. but a human who cannot die in the traditional sense. For example, [[Tharem]] (Human Arem/Broken Arem in dragon-language) lived 500 years laying low until they got fatally injured when a village got invaded in a war. [[Tharem]] didnt just end, but mutated into [[Inkiab]] ("second born son" in a human language where [[Tharem]] died). Almost a mellenium later, [[Inkiab]] gave way to [[Aivener]] who later establishes the [[surturins]]. She was able to do this because everytime a broken dragon-human mutates upon death, the new being gains a small reserve of [[Chaos Magic]] that is a fraction of the original [[Arem]]'s magic. This magic is what [[Aivener]] used to create the system by which [[humans]] can elect to send their souls to her for the [[surturins]]
