These [[Dragons]] were the first to be born from [[Chaos]] at the beginning of the [[Age of Chaos]]. The first to be born of these dragons was [[Dragunthar, The First Dragon|Dragunthar]], and the only defining property of these dragons was that they were capable of conscious thought. Aside from that, they did not resemble dragons in any way, at least not until dragons began to manipulate the Chaos and hold power over [[Chaos Magic]], which they then used to make more desirable forms for themselves that all other dragons descended from. This is why wyrms, drakes, wyverns, and so on all look somewhat different, as they are all differing descendants of The First Dragons.
