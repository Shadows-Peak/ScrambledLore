An ancient society that thrived upon their usage of [[Magic]]. The [[Proto-Humans]] that inhabited this sprawling city focused on utilizing Magic to accomplish all their basic needs with as little effort as possible. This included making machines that use Magic in order to create the desired outcomes. However, it was shunned to rely on too much machinery, as Magic was viewed as the superior art form, and thus over reliance was punishable. A group of scholars dared to claim that machinery was an art that would take Magic to even greater heights, but they were all banished to far away lands that were then formed into [[Arthas]].

Magus Optimus, however, ran a long course of history, only ending when they began to gain interest in [[Draconic Magic]]. This caused [[Dragonia]] to see Magus Optimus as a threat, as they believed that Magus Optimus would stop at no lengths to acquire and harvest [[Dragons]] for their own gain. Given Dragonia's relationship with Dragons, they immediately waged war upon Magus Optimus, who despite their great power was not yet ready to fight against Dragons. Dragonia sent many Dragons over, but [[Siethun]] was the Dragon that caused the most destruction, and was praised back in Dragonia for this.

The remnants of Magus Optimus became a variety of different smaller nations throughout time, but after the [[Formation of Draguia]], Magus Optimus was reinstated under the name [[Novum Optimus]] after they acquired [[The Egg]]. They remained a rather small nation until [[Ovus]] split The Egg and formed the [[Bearer of the Egg|Bearers of the Egg]].
