An ancient society that thrived upon their usage of [[Magic]]. The [[Proto-Humans]] that inhabited this sprawling city focused on utilizing Magic to accomplish all their basic needs with as little effort as possible. This included making machines that use Magic in order to create the desired outcomes. However, it was shunned to rely on too much machinery, as Magic was viewed as the superior art form, and thus over reliance was punishable. A group of scholars dared to claim that machinery was an art that would take Magic to even greater heights, but they were all banished to far away lands that were then formed into [[Arthas]].

Magus Optimus, however, ran a long course of history, only ending when they began to gain interest in [[Draconic Magic]]. This caused [[Dragonia]] to see Magus Optimus as a threat, as they believed that Magus Optimus would stop at no lengths to acquire and harvest [[Dragons]] for their own gain. Given Dragonia's relationship with Dragons, they immediately waged war upon Magus Optimus, who despite their great power was not yet ready to fight against Dragons. Dragonia sent many Dragons over, but [[Siethun]] was the Dragon that caused the most destruction, and was praised back in Dragonia for this.

The remnants of Magus Optimus became a variety of different smaller nations throughout time, but after the [[Formation of Draguia]], Magus Optimus was reinstated under the name [[Novum Optimus]] after they acquired [[The Egg]]. They remained a rather small nation until [[Ovus]] split The Egg and formed the [[Bearer of the Egg|Bearers of the Egg]].



### Events Throughout History
==**~4700 DA**== :  [[Havus, The First Prodigy|Havus]] journeys the continent of [[Navu#Medrum|Medrum]] on the search for powerful mages.

==**~4650 DA**== :  Havus instructs some of the scholars in his party to investigate the sighting of a dragon that supposedly has kidnapped the weak and crippled people in the area.

==**~4645 DA**== :  These scholars manage to meet with [[Salgus, the Carrier|Salgus]] and a dispute breaks out ending with most of the scholars staying behind with Salgus whilst the others return to Havus.

==**~4643 DA**== :  Some of the scholars return to Havus and inform them that the dragon truly wishes to help people and that the others have stayed behind to study it. Havus instructs them to check up on them in some time but that the dragon was no longer his concern.

==**~4640 DA**== :  Some scholars head out to find Salgus in order to check up on the others that stayed behind.

==**~4635 DA**== :  The scholars find Salgus, commune with the scholars, and return to Havus. They tell of the great knowledge Salgus holds over their own kind. Havus wishes to meet the dragon.

==**~4632 DA**== :  Havus meets Salgus and they become close.

==**~4629 DA**== :  Havus requests Salgus to inform him on the location of a [[Chaos Dragons|Chaos Dragon]] that could teach him how to use [[Chaos Magic]] more proficiently.  Salgus eventually agrees and takes him to [[Vokzan, the Prophet|Vokzan]] due to them being the only Chaos Dragon that Salgus readily knows and that may be willing to help.

==**~4624 DA**== :  Vokzan scoffs at Havus’ attempt to, in Vokzan’s words, “join the ranks of the dragons,” and as such decides to send Havus thousands of years into the future.

==**~4623 DA**== :  In honor of Havus, whom they believed dead, the remaining scholars and mages create a shrine in his honor and build a town around it, as many had no family to return to. This town would be known as Hava.

==**~4340 DA**== :  Salgus visits a developed Hava and asks if scholars remain in their ranks. Upon confirmation, these scholars meet the preserved scholars within [[Salganoia]]. The knowledge imparted on them sparks a renaissance in Hava focused upon scholarly matters.

==**~4270 DA**== :  Hava is visited by a neighboring kingdom and requests help in felling a dragon that has been harassing their kingdom as they have heard that the inhabitants of the town knew much of dragons. The residents of Hava decline leading to a slaughter being led on the village.

==**~4269 DA**== :  Survivors are either enslaved, run away to take up life elsewhere, or are still dedicated to their lifestyle and goals and decide to recreate Hava elsewhere.

==**~4267 DA**== :  A group of surviving mages and scholars of great influence and strength take refuge far away and begin to create a settlement dedicated to mages.

==**~4266 DA**== :  Groups venture out from this settlement to find promising mages, much like Havus had originally done over 400 years ago. However, instead of becoming an adventuring party, they all formed at this settlement now.

==**~4237 DA**== :  The settlement had gone by many names, but it was around this time that it had now been jokingly referred to as Magus Optimus as it was full of very powerful mages.

==**~4186 DA**== :  Across some generations, the name had transcended a mere joke and it became the name of what was now beginning to more so resemble a village of Mages that all now had kids and grandchildren that too were being taught the arcane.

==**~3974 DA**== :  Magus Optimus is officially recognized as a small nation.




# Blah blah blah separating into several provinces eventually, civil wars, gets larger and larger of a territory. Kinda like china. Final? and most secure iteration forms around 2700. The name of Magus Optimus is not always kept and is instead return to in this great stability as a tribute to their founding fathers.
