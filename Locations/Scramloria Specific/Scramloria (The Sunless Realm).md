**(==79 DB== - ==111 DB==)**
Scramloria was created by [[Xavier]] alongside the [[Order of the Eclipse]] with the goal to give people an escape from magic during the height of the [[Era of Prosperity]]. Of course, it was Xavier's secret goal to use it as a place to keep the [[Prodigy Child (Probot)|Prodigy Child]] away from the rest of the world, and particularly his fellow [[Bearer of the Egg|Bearers of the Egg]].

Scramloria was ruled based upon the strength of its people. They had a warrior culture that believed only the strongest would have the privilege of commanding others.
