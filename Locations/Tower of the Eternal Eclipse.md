Located in the heart of [[Scramloria (The Sunless Realm)|Scramloria]], this tower serves as a holding place for a powerful artifact that the [[Order of the Eclipse]] put their power together in creating. It uses [[Draconic Magic]] to hold together the sheer [[Magic]] poured into it in its creation. The spell dictates that all other than [[Xavier]] within Scramloria are unable to utilize Magic.
