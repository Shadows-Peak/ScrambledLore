Means "Dimension" in [[Dragon Tongue]]. This is the name given to the floating world that all life typically takes rest upon. Some exceptions to this are [[Dragons]], .


## The Formation Process
As Navu forms, the farther out you go tends to have more uneven distributions of [[Chaos]] coming from the [[Anomaly]] and thus biomes like deserts or tundras form from lesser amounts of energy whereas things like forests can form with excess. 

Dead creatures with a lot of energy or things with a lot of energy in general can form into mountains or glaciers. These glaciers will overtime carve out landscapes like lakes and rivers. Water can generally form too but only as a result of storms that can stir up from heavier fluctuations deriving from the anomaly. 

Energy that radiates downwards has more pressure on it from what else has been formed and thus typically forms itself more into a rocky form, though it can become minerals or sometimes caves with similar things to the surface layer under proper conditions.

Energy that escapes upwards floats freely and glides across all that has already been created. This allows it to coalesce up higher, either forming clouds, getting trapped in a magical barrier equivalent to an atmosphere, or (in majority) ascends super high and clumps into the equivalent of a sun. This sun object has Chaos flowing into it from different angles, propelling it around so that it revolves around the top side of Navu, meaning Navu never can become pitch dark and only increasingly close to such as the sun is always somewhere off in the distance, it never drops below a horizon or anything. This sun object isn’t quite like our own, and it works in a way where a majority of the light it produces gets cast beneath it in a cone, where as rays originating from higher up it would be progressively dimmer. This is because less chaos energy reaches the higher parts of the object as opposed to the bottom parts. However, the chaos that goes into it and moves it around can also cause it to rotate as an object slightly and can make the brightest parts of the sun aim in different directions than it usually would for some time before it settles to normal.

## ==Features==:

### Medrum
A giant continent in the very center of Navu that holds the Anomaly and houses many powerful creatures due to the aforementioned artifact.

### The Ring
A ring of water cutting Medrum off from the rest of Navu. It was formed as a result of a disturbance of surrounding Chaos due to [[Aternos vs. Grandun|the fight that ensued just prior to its formation]].

### Zalde Strip
The Zalde strip, which means “Terminal” strip in dragon tongue, is the circle of land that formed after The Ring finished forming, and ends as the land begins to subdivide from [[Ul Vikel Ebragi|further interaction]]. It is often just referred to as Zalde.

It is referred to as the terminal due to it being the connecting point between many continents in the central world and the originating point of humanoid life forms.
