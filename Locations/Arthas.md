Mechanical city inhabited originally by [[Dragons|Dragon]]-worshipping [[Humans]] who were graced by the presence of [[Grandun, the Great Dragon]]. Grandun allowed the Humans to partake in an [[Oath]] with him leading to the creation of [[Artificiods]].

### Events Throughout History
==**~2400 DA**== :  Arthas is formed by a group of scholars who had been banished from their homeland, [[Magus Optimus]], with the goal of using machinery and [[Magic]] together in perfect unison.

==**~2300 DA**== :  Arthas is attacked by Magus Optimus and is left in ruin as the remaining people are left to pick up the scraps, massively slowing down the speed of progression.

==**~1900 DA**== :  Grandun visits the lands of Arthas in his gear-like form, inspiring Arthans to utilize such designs for their benefits.

==**~1850 DA**== :  Grandun visits once again, this time sleeping and protecting Arthas by coiling his body around it. Grandun enters a great slumber while Arthans begin to inspect his body.

==**~1700 DA**== :  Several complex designs had already been made and put to use, but it is at this time that construction of a prototype Artificiod completes, however they find no way to power it, and begin to analyze the Magics that make up Grandun.

==**~1630 DA**== :  Grandun completes a nearly 220 year slumber as he wakes to the sight of Arthas having advanced greatly. It is at this time that Grandun makes an Oath with the people of Arthas, and the first Artificiod, [[Artho]], is made.

==**~1600 DA**== :  Grandun departs from Arthas, having changed material designs many times during his slumber, and left in a glimmering glass form.

==**~1400 DA**== :  The Artificiod is perfected and a civil war begins as they make claim to hold rights.

==**~1390 DA**== :  The Artificiods win and are recognized as fully sapient beings by the people of Arthas. However, the rights of Artificiods are still of great debate.

==**~1300 DA**== :  Artificiods hold equal rights to that of Humans.

==**~800 DA**== :  Artificiods begin to out populate Humans.

==**~740 DA**== :  As the numbers of Humans dwindle, they begin to lose their rights within Arthas.

==**~710 DA**== :  After many mini-skirmishes and outrages, Humans are fully stripped of their rights and viewed as lesser than by Artificiods.

==**~680 DA**== :  After 30 years of being used as slaves and for experiments, the **Human Exclusion Act** is passed and all Humans are either to be outcast or slain.

==**~665 DA**== :  The last Human dies within Arthas. Arthas is exclusively inhabited by Artificiods now, and they are incredibly Xenophobic to all species deemed to have "less intelligence." The only exception is that of Dragons, of course Artificiods still consider themselves superior to most dragons.

==**~630 DA**== :  To prove their superiority, and to advance their magic, Artificiods begin to design devices to kill Dragons with.

==**~350 DA**== :  The [[Chaos Backprocessor]] is invented by the Artificiods.

==**~330 DA**== :  As both a proof of concept and for the future of Magical development, the Artificiods use the Chaos Backprocessor and fell a [[Chaos Dragons|Chaos Dragon]], albeit one of the youngest ones.

==**~327 DA**== :  The land of Arthas is entirely decimated by several Chaos Dragons. Only that which was underground survived.

==**~190 DA**== :  Arthas finishes developing a new sprawling underground city, and has entirely hidden their presence from the surface.

==**~87 DA**== :  Arthas begins production of automatons in hopes of creating one that can take advantage of a Chaos Backprocessor.

==**0 DB**== :  Artho is re-activated after being excavated from their deep burial site.

==**7 DB**== :  Artho volunteers for a new program to construct humanoid appearing Artificiods for infiltrating Human societies.

==**9 DB**== :  Artho is disguised as a sort of Human, despite still being an Artificiod, and is given several upgrades to their dated design.

==**23 DB**== :  A search party of several Human-disguised Artificiods discover that the [[Formation of Draguia]] had occurred and that [[The Egg]] exists.

==**24 DB**== :  Secret development on a way to harvest The Egg's power begins.

==**28 DB**== :  Arthans figure out how to harvest The Egg's power, so they send out Artho once again to find it.

==**29 DB**== :  Artho learns that The Egg has been shattered.

==**31 DB**== :  Artificiods begin work on AI's that do not operate off of physical form like they do.

==**45 DB**== :  Arthans begin to work on their final model of automaton.

==**92 DB**== :  The shell of the final automaton is completed, and now the installation of the Chaos Backprocessor begins.

==**98 DB**== :  The Chaos Backprocessor is installed, but the automaton is not finished until they give it a proper conscientiousness model.

==**119 DB**== :  The method of housing a non-corporeal intelligence is completed by utilizing Chaos energy.

==**123 DB**== :  The final automaton, **Probot**, is finished as it is installed with a non-corporeal intelligence.

==**134 DB**== :  Development of a super AI begins.

==**178 DB**== :  The super AI, [[NAHFL]], is completed.

==**203 DB**== :  [[Prodigy Child (Probot)|He Who Watches]] possesses the final automaton **Probot** and the Artificiods realize this and ask the goal of the pseudo-God. When He Who Watches says he intends to kill all living creatures that stand before him, the Artificiods say he is welcome to do so, as they have far surpassed such lowly creatures nearly a millennia ago and could care less what happens to them. The [[Probot Massacre]] commences.
