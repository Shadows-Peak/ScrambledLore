**Brief Overview:**
Everything will start with the [[Age of Chaos]] and advance into the [[Dragon Age]] after [[Aternos]]' [[Unification of Magic]]. In the Dragon Age, [[Humans]] fought against the [[Dragons]] to gain more magical prowess. At the end of this war, Aternos sacrificed themselves to create a parallel reality known as [[Draguia]] housed entirely within [[Zataukeru, Grave of Aternos|Aternos' grave]]. Aternos created a seal around the tomb that required [[Chaos Magic]] to open, making only the [[Prodigy]] and [[Chaos Dragons]] able to open it. At some point, [[Xavier]], who was a [[Bearer of the Egg]], ran away with the current prodigy-the [[Prodigy Child (Probot)|Prodigy Child]]-and created [[Scramloria (The Sunless Realm)|Scramloria]], a place where magic was unable to be used by anyone other than Xavier himself. Eventually, [[Novum Optimus]] laid [[Fall of Scramloria|siege]] upon Scramloria leading to the [[Prodigy's Disembodiment]]. Only about another 100 years later, the [[Probot Massacre]] occurs. Shortly after the time that [[His Weakening]] occurs, the events of our modern day server will take place.
