A mystical anomaly found in the heart of [[Navu]] that allows the energy of [[Chaos]] to neatly form the world sprouting out from it. It is likely that this was either an intended or unintended side effect of the [[Unification of Magic]] as it sort of acts like a huge knot between the strands of [[Magics/Magic|Magic]] that permeate outwards from it.

It is debatable if the Anomaly is a physical object one could touch or if it is merely akin to a black hole but formed from dense fields of Magic that are untouchable by mortals.

### Side Effects
Beings of great power born near the Anomaly are often so interwoven in its strands that they are tethered to either the immediate area or at least just the continent of [[Navu#Medrum|Medrum]].

It is typical that things either born within some distance of the anomaly, or that spend much time in proximity to it, acquire stronger [[Affinity|Affinities]] and other connections like that of the [[Soul]] are usually strengthened too.
