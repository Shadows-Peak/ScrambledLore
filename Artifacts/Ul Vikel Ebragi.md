Literally translates from [[Dragon Tongue]] to “The Resistant Eye”. Also known as “Ebragi” (for just “The Eye”), although ‘Ebragi’ typically refers to just one piece of it, and not the whole as ‘Ul Vikel Ebragi’ does.

The Ebragi are a set of 8 monoliths placed at roughly 45 degree turns of each other from the [[Anomaly]] as the center point and true north as the starting point. They rest relatively equidistant from the center of [[Navu]] and mark the ends of the Zalde Strip.

The Ebragi were masterworks by [[Enzadagon]] that could disrupt the subtle changes in chaos that the Anomaly sent out just perfectly so that water would be formed up to a reasonable depth in place of any signals that touched an Ebragi.

The Ebragi are nigh indestructible and haven’t been harmed to any considerable degree before. It is also worth noting that they attempted to sync the placement of the Ebragi as best they could, but there was realistically a gap sometimes as great as a couple hours between placements and as such the split was not perfectly even across the whole entirety of the Zalde Strip.
