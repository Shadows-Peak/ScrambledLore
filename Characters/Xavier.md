A bastard child of a great mage that passed shortly after giving birth to Xavier. He was born with an incredibly [[Affinity]] for almost all forms of [[Magic]], though his affinity for water was absent. His mother had left with him, as a child, a map to a crypt that held all their treasures and even journals through which to learn about [[Dragons]].

Xavier was left fending for himself as a toddler on the streets however, and so he was taken away and sold into slavery. The map was not lost though, as a spell was placed on it by his mom so that it could only be seen by Xavier. When Xavier came to be around 6, they recognized his capabilities and sent him to the test for the [[Prodigy]]. Following this, interest in him as a slave increased slightly, despite still being so young. This led to [[Sango]] purchasing him. Sango spent a good deal of money on mentors to come and train Xavier. Eventually however, Xavier was sold to the [[Ovo]], where he then quickly ran away with [[Ovus]] and started upon a nomadic lifestyle.
