Grandun is a [[Chaos Dragons|Chaos Dragon]] that chose to stay behind instead of joining the others in [[Draguia]] upon the [[Formation of Draguia]]. Having been alive since before [[Dragons]] could even harness [[Chaos Magic]], and being one of [[The First Dragons]], Grandun is a rather powerful figure. Grandun is the ancestor of all wyrm-type dragons, and is known to change their materialistic form every lunar cycle.

Grandun is a rather curious dragon, and he was experimenting with rather intriguing configurations when he came across a clockwork design with which to mold his body from. It was in this form that the people of [[Arthas]] first came across Grandun, and they began to worship him. Before Grandun departed and changed forms, the people of Arthas struck up an [[Oath]] with him, allowing them to create the [[Artificiods|Artificiods]] and have a permanent source of power with which to fuel their most ambitious creations moving forward.
