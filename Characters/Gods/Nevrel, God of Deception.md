Nevrel has been encoded with the [[Oath#Pact|Pact of Deception]] by [[Legyre, The Storyteller|Legyre]]. He has been around since at least before [[The Ring Wars]].

## Pact of Deception
Nevrel must use his powers of [[Chaos Magic]] only to grant capabilities relating to trickery or stealth. He must also only use his powers for his own use so long as it leads to uncertainty over at least one element in any interaction involving it that cannot be discerned by present parties save him. Disobedience will result in [[Gods#Erosion of Will|Erosion of Will]]; this has already been experienced once by Nevrel, who now truly fears it.

Nevrel can do the following using this Pact:
- Project anything using his head as the center
- Control all senses of those within 10 meters of him.
- Undo an event that is guaranteed to happen (If the flow of chaos and time perfectly predicts an event, he can undo that before it occurs)
- Morph his or others appearances without their knowledge or others knowledge
- Can turn anyone’s conscience into a pocket dimension that others can be dragged into upon thought of them
- Can invade the minds of others
- Can spur any form of weather within a mile radius
- Can possess other people that have spoken his name within a mile radius before
- Grant most of these abilities to others
