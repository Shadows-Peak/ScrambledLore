## Namesake
Disliked the name Auberstone, as he associated it with his poor father. Jon ran off during the Ring Wars and pillaged nations that were too focused on their warfronts to have adequate protection over wealth and treasures. Eventually, Jon comes back to flaunt his wealth to those he had grown up with originally, not saying where it came from. In turn, however, he was made fun of for getting his wealth from his daddy. He came to learn that his father had hidden the generation wealth behind the Auberstone family, and upon his death Jon was in the will to gain it. By this time, he had already jokingly changed his name to Johnathon Monébaggs and tossed the Auberstone out his name, but out of respect for his late father and his desire to live a normal life and hope to teach his son how to live poor. Thanking his father for allowing him the opportunity to travel the world—having fled from home—he retakes the Auberstone name, however he mainly goes by Monébaggs to keep up his new lifestyle, and he reclaims the wealth left for him.

## Powers
Before returning home, Johnathon went to [[Vokzan, the Prophet]] in hopes of learning about what may befall him in his future. He learned that the title “Prophet” was mostly just that, a title. However, Vokzan informed Johnathon that there may come a time where his wealth grows astronomically larger through an unexpected means (Vokzan knew this as Johnathon’s father had already written the will at this point). Vokzan also took interest in what he saw within Johnathon’s mind, seeing an incredibly rebellious and mischievous soul that sought to live his own life. In this interest, Vokzan gave Johnathon a [[Clock of Recall|pocket watch]].
