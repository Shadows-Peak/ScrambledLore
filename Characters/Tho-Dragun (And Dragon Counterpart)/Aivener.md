#via 
full name: Aivener kshev s'remtier
she is a [[Tho-Dragun]]
daughter of Kshev ([[Inkiab]]) of the [[#Lineage|Lineage of Arem (s'Remtier)]]
Stewardess of [[Surturins]].

## **Lineage**:
The s'Remtier line goes back to the [[Unification of Magic]]. [[Arem]] was a [[Dragons|dragon]] that in fear of being eradicated as a part of the 20% of dragons who died, was forced to quantum-hibernate and eons later reawake as a human. but a human who cannot die in the traditional sense. For example, Tharem (Human Arem/Broken Arem in dragon-language) lived 500 years laying low until they got fatally injured when a village got invaded in a war. Tharem didnt just end, but mutated into Inkiab ("second born son" in a human language where Tharem died). Almost a mellenium later, Inkiab gave way to Aivener who later establishes the Surturins. She was able to do this because everytime a broken dragon-human mutates upon death, the new being gains a small reserve of [[Chaos Magic]] that is a fraction of the original Arem's magic. This magic is what Aivener used to create the system by which [[Humans]] can elect to send their souls to her for the Surturins.
