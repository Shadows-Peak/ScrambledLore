A [[Followers of He|zealot]] that believes [[Prodigy|prodigies]] are the final life form and the true [[Gods]] of existence. His one true goal is the complete expansion of power to [[Prodigy Child (Probot)|He Who Watches]] and the decimation of [[Draguia]].

### Early Life
Zandethar was born to a colony of [[Dragon Zealots]]. He was given the title “-thar” which means “King” in [[Dragon Tongue]] and honors [[Dragunthar, the First Dragon]]. Despite this, Zandethar was also being influenced by a traitor of the colony and grew to secretly hold disdain and hatred towards the race of [[Dragons]]. As just a little boy, he raced off with this traitor in hopes of killing a dragon. They did not know, however, that this dragon was [[Neru, the Galloping Beast]]. The result of the hunt was Zandethar being left isolated and with a curse; the ability to read and manipulate others’ thoughts, as well as have his own thoughts be publicly projected from his mind if he ever loses temper or strength.
