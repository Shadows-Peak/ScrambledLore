Yeva was one of [[The First Dragons]] and became particularly concerned with the loss of what she deemed her friends after [[Kupaulus, the Hidden Dragon|Kupaulus]] was ‘killed’ by [[Zosciva, the Flaming Dragon|Zosciva]], resulting in her creation of the [[Soul]].

### Invention of the Soul and its effect on Immortality
Her construct of the Soul allowed The First Dragons hasty recovery from their deaths as opposed to taking a lengthy time to reforge their bodies after losing control of the [[Chaos]] binding them from fatigue or force. For all other creatures that did not originally forge their body from Chaos and thus do not actively keep themselves bound, such as the future [[Chaos Dragons]], death is more permanent and typically contains one’s energy into their Soul to allow a chance at having a new body be created by either themselves or another. This means Chaos dragons are typically immortal too, though they cannot recycle the same body in most instances, and if no one else helps them and they possess too little Chaos to create a new body, then they are still capable of being killed fully. All future creatures (including [[Dragons]] born after the [[Unification of Magic]]) simply cannot create themselves a new body at all when in a soul form and thus are mortal in comparison.
