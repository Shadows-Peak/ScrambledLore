Gareth was born in [[Scramloria (The Sunless Realm)|Scramloria]] and became the Lord of  [[Ishoria]] due to his freakish power.

He was about 23 when the [[Fall of Scramloria]] occurred. Most who suffered from the effects of [[Nightfall]] perished, but Gareth was strong enough to actually survive and, though he had [[Magic Sickness]], he was able to gain [[Magic|Magical capabilities]].

After the Fall of Scramloria, he spent about 137 years doing other things learning about the circumstances leading to the death of everyone he had ever known and how to defeat [[Prodigy Child (Probot)|He Who Remains]] before returning to the ruins of Scramloria and using his knowledge to cause [[His Weakening]].
