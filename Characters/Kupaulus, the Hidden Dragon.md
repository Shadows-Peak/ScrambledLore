Fusion of “Kupaudi” in [[Dragon Tongue]] (meaning Caution) and “Solus” in Latin (meaning Alone).

Kupaulus was one of [[The First Dragons]] who was deemed as a scaredy-cat and often bullied by [[Dragons]] both born alongside them and after them. Out of such a deep desire of not being associated with the others, they chose to not conform their body to the acts of reproduction, thus making it so no descendants were ever formed via contraception from Kupaulus and instead were to be willingly made by their decision on few occasions. Kupaulus is also genderless as a result.

### Children
There are only a few cases of Kupaulus decided to make an offspring. These moments typically came in bouts of spite or loneliness and would serve as a distraction or tool of revenge. Kupaulus’ first child was [[Legyre]]. Third child was [[Vokzan, the Prophet|Vokzan]].

### Relationships
Given the mostly solitary nature and the ‘punching bag’ role that Kupaulus often serves to other Dragons, they are not close with many others.

One of Kupaulus’ only friends among The First Dragons is [[Yeva, the Stable Dragon|Yeva]] and they hold a deep hatred for [[Zosciva, the Flaming Dragon|Zosciva]]. Kupaulus has had many conversations with [[Grandun, the Great Dragon|Grandun]] before and they hold a respect towards each other for holding somewhat more solitary lifestyles, of course Grandun still is much more active with other Dragons and enjoys interacting with creatures of all types. 

### Death and Rebirth
Kupaulus was the first creature to ever be killed, however death was not an extremely rigid concept at the time, and so it was more that the [[Chaos]] holding Kupaulus in form was disrupted and a long time would need to pass before Kupaulus could interact with the world the same.

This death, which was accidentally (as The First Dragons did not yet know that anything akin to death could occur) caused by Zosciva was greatly devastating in concept to Yeva who created the [[Concepts/Soul|Soul]] and gave structure to the Chaos that binds them allowing for death to not take so long to overcome.

As an immediate consequence, Kupaulus was able to reform themselves together in a rather short amount of time.
