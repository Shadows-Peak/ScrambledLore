Fusion of “Zode” (in [[Dragon Tongue]]) for performed (so like Zod-/Zo- for performer people or playful people) and “Lasciva” meaning playful in Latin.

Zosciva was one of [[The First Dragons]] and was particularly keen on ‘roughhousing’ with the others by fighting them in [[Chaos Magic|magic]]-less combat.
