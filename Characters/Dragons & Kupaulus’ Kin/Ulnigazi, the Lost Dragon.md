Fusion of “Ulnugazi” and “Ulkige” meaning ‘Hell’ and ‘Race’ in [[Dragon Tongue]] respectively, leading to the name of ‘Hell Race’

Ulnigazi was the last of [[The First Dragons]] and the [[Dragons|Dragon]] to decide to force particles of [[Chaos]] farther apart so that the spontaneous creation of more Dragons was no longer possible. Before the knowledge of how to use [[Chaos Magic]] was acquired, some formations were beginning to come along, so Ulnigazi ran away from the other First Dragons to systematically find and exterminate all life forms that were born ‘without his permission’.
