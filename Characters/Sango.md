The old master of [[Xavier]]. He was a nobleman and scholar who was curious in the great [[Affinity]] that Xavier held, as well as his status as having been one of 5 children who were tested upon the possibility of being the [[Prodigy]]. He took it as an opportunity to create a great mage, and later on as an opportunity to make a profit in what he deemed a “flip.” He eventually sold Xavier to [[Ovo]].
