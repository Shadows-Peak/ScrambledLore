perhaps via's character



"the s'Remtier line goes back to the unification of magic. Arem was a dragon that in fear of being eradicated as a part of the 20% of dragons who died, was forced to quantum-hibernate and eons later reawake as a human. but a human who cannot die in the traditional sense. For example, Tharem (Human Arem/Broken Arem in dragon-language) lived 500 years laying low until they got fatally injured when a village got invaded in a war. Arem didnt just end, but mutated into Inkiab ("second born son" in a human language where Tharem died). Almost a mellenium later, Inkiab gave way to Aivener who later establishes the surturins. She was able to do this because everytime a broken dragon-human mutates upon death, the new being gains a small reserve of chaos magic that is a fraction of the original Arem's magic. This magic, aivener used to create the system by which humans can elect to send their souls to her for the surturins"

s'Remtier : "its a linguistic mutation of Tharem (th turns into s and tier is some noun ending or something)"

"so Kshev refers to Inkiab and s'Remtier refers to the original Tharem/Arem"
