Originally a [[Dragons|dragon]] who lived up to just before the [[Formation of Draguia]] where they decided they did not wish to leave [[Navu]]. This prompted them to attempt refuge with [[Humans]], however they turned on Yunem and attempted to murder him. Yunem attempted to sacrifice himself in order to retaliate and finally move on, but the circumstances caused a disturbance that saw Yunem awaking 100 hundred years later. In this form, he was known as Thonem once he learned of his previous life as a dragon. They were somewhat angry that they had amnesia over their rebirth, and attempted to seek out a method of connecting their memories once again. In their efforts, Thonem was attacked after only 38 years of living by a group of bandits and ended up losing their life in the process. Thonem then was reborn as Kahrin around another 100 years later, and it was in this life that they successfully learned of their previous identities, and even obtained the memories. He changed his name to Yunem once again after only 19 years, and began to dedicate himself to the creation of [[Firelash]] in hopes that they would be able to restore memories and purpose to him if Yunem ever does die and once again rebirth.

In the modern day, Yunem is a [[Tho-Dragun]] mage and alchemist with the goal of establishing longevity in their identity.
