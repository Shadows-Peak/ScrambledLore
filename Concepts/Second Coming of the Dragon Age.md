Many [[Dragon Zealots|people]] believe in re-instating an effect closer to the early days of the [[Dragon Age]] wherein [[Dragons]] are once again let to roam free and would then be allotted more [[Magic]] for birth than [[Humans]], thus restoring the Dragons' former glory. This goal would be accomplished by utilizing someone who can perform uses of [[Chaos Magic]], like the [[Prodigy]], and then opening the seal to [[Zataukeru, Grave of Aternos|Zataukeru]].
