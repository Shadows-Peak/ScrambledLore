A primordial form of energy that holds infinite power. Any reality can spontaneously erupt forth from this energy, and it is the embodiment of all creation, existence, and likelihood. It is with this energy that the first dragon, [[Dragunthar, The First Dragon|Dragunthar]], was formed. Given that it was but a random occurrence, all of [[The First Dragons]] do not look as you would expect a dragon to look necessarily, at least not at first. It wasn't until other horrors were born and fought each other that they began to wonder if they could increase their lethality. Rather than bashing their corporeal forms into each other, some dragons opted to tap into the Chaos surrounding them. Catching onto this, many of The First Dragons began to compete for finding a way to touch the Chaos. The first dragon to manage this connection to Chaos and utilize [[Chaos Magic]], albeit rather poorly, was [[Unavi]].
