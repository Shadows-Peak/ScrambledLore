On the creation of a lifeform, around the same time [[Chaos]] is collapsing into an [[Affinity]], a metaphysical object is formed that acts as a sort of gravitational prison for the [[Magic]] a creature possesses called a soul. It isn't necessarily gravity, but the magic of a person is bound by some barrier that the soul forms. As magic is the fundamental force that forms all beings, a soul being it's bounding force makes it a rather fundamental part of your identity. Furthermore, when the soul is separated from the body, magic tends to form a stretched hourglass shape having a bulb where the soul is and where the body is. With this, one can technically extend the control of their most potent magic past just the bounds of their soul, but it can place the user at a great risk. If the magic lingering between the soul and body is severed by any manner, the soul cannot return to its body and enters a purgatory-like state where it can roam the world freely but only for as long as the magic it contains hasn't  burnt out due to no organic systems refreshing it. If this process completes, a soul is transported to [[Surturins]] (however one can opt in to going there early), otherwise, one can become something like a [[Wraiths#Enwraiths|Enwraith]] in order to sustain themselves and remain in [[Navu]].
