For beings, spells, or machineries with excessive [[Magic]] and essentially perfect [[Affinity|Affinities]], a process similar to how things like the [[Chaos Backprocessor]] can translate Magic back into [[Chaos]] is able to occur. This is incredibly hard as a process to actually control, but when things exceed the bounds of the [[Unification of Magic]] spell, a temporary overload is performed that allows for a quick execution of [[Chaos Magic]] with whatever is able to be translated from Magic to Chaos in that short moment that the spell is over strained.
