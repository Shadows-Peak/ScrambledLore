The concentration of so many [[Chaos Dragons]] into one spot ([[Zataukeru, Grave of Aternos]]) caused [[Chaos]] energy to behave a little strangely, causing [[Legyre]] to create the cycle of the Prodigy. The Prodigy is to be able to harness [[Chaos Magic]] so as to keep its flow from going stagnant and clumping around Zataukeru too much.

This is a concept that Legyre had previously played around with before as a proof of concept with the creation of [[Havus, The First Prodigy|Havus]]. It should be noted that, the creation of the prodigy then was unrelated to the flow of Chaos and Legyre simply wanted to have fun.

### The Cycle of the Prodigy
Every 10 years after the prior Prodigy has died, Chaos energy will shoot away from Zataukeru and coalesce elsewhere into the formation of the Prodigy.
