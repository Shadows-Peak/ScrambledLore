“Veldun” is “Knowledge” in [[Dragon Tongue]], and so it follows that “Veldra” is “Mathematics” in [[Enzuvci]] (and later [[Common]]).

Veldra had not become Veldra until it had been heavily formalized. Up until this point, different communities could perform basic calculations using their own cultural methods. Some cultures recognized that the use it held allowed for a lot of time to be saved, and so it began picking up steam in places. This eventually lead to [[Kusax Fildenroe]] taking note of the flaws upon which their system rested with and decided to formalize and introduce precision into the practice, that way they could have a firm basis that no others could mock. Fildenroe spread this system around and spent his time convincing others of its superiority as a system.
