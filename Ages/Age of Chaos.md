At the beginning of time-no, even before that-there was [[Chaos]]. From this Chaos erupted [[The First Dragons]]. Eventually, [[Unavi]] managed to tap into the powers of [[Chaos Magic]], which developed into an art that was necessary to master for any dragons or else they would suffer death at the hands of another. These powerful [[Chaos Dragons]] only grew more and more powerful as they procreated, as it takes Chaos to form a dragon, and some of the Chaos of the parents would be inherited into the offspring, creating a positive feedback loop. As these dragons became more and more dense with Chaos, they were able to better control the unpredictable nature of Chaos Magic, however, this caused them to generally be weaker in return with what they could manage in these controlled situations. As a solution, a dragon known as [[Aternos]] performed an incredibly powerful spell with Chaos Magic that caused the energies of chaos to condense into a variety of different weaker energies that weaved together to create [[Magic]] in an event known as the [[Unification of Magic]]. This, of course, was only able to be done due to Aternos' increased Chaos Magic control, and the massacre of 20% of [[Dragons|Dragon-kind]]. This massacre was done so that Aternos had enough Chaos energy to actually perform the giant spell that was the Unification of Magic. Once Chaos was split into threads and weaved into the fluid and malleable energy of Magic, the Age of Chaos came to a close.
