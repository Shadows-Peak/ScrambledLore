Immediately succeeding the [[Formation of Draguia]] and [[Humans|Human-kind]]'s acquisition of [[The Egg]], the Era of Prosperity began. It is in this sense we begin to see that those who care to record the history of the world from this point onwards is almost entirely composed of humans, as it was seen that no other race showed any signs of prosperity in this time. In a fate much akin to our own world, humans would rape the world of its resources with little concern of any adverse effects to come in the future. As more and more prowess over magic was attained, other lifeforms suffered more and more at the hands of human-kind's exploitation.

It was but only for a couple decades that humans were without a clue of how to exploit the dormant powers within [[The Egg]], but eventually a mage came along who decided to shatter the egg into fragments so that its power could be broken into simpler pieces that were easier to take advantage of. This mage, [[Ovus]], came to be the first [[Bearer of the Egg]] as she took one of these fragments and began to distribute the remaining ones to other well-to-do mages. One of these mages, [[Xavier]], came to grow discontent towards the way the world was advancing.

Before Xavier left, there was a roughly 3 year period where the nation that Ovus was from, [[Magus Optimus|Magalo]] reformed into [[Novum Optimus]] as the Bearers of the Egg took control as a council to lead the growing nation.

## Scramloria and the Events Around It
As a result, Xavier stole the current [[Prodigy]] from the chambers they were held in in order to seal them away from the rest of the world permanently. This was because the others Bearers were speaking of using the Prodigy to open [[Zataukeru, Grave of Aternos|Zataukeru]] and bring about the [[Second Coming of the Dragon Age]]. To accomplish this goal of sealing them away, Xavier took the [[Prodigy Child (Probot)|Prodigy Child]] to [[Dragonia]] and performed a great spell at the [[Tower of the Eternal Eclipse]] alongside likeminded individuals of both great strength ([[Order of the Eclipse]]) and of great weakness (Those who would come to inhabit this land). From that moment on, the lands of Dragonia were repurposed into [[Scramloria (The Sunless Realm)|Scramloria]]. The Prodigy Child, and all other members of the Order of the Eclipse, took refuge deep within [[Shadow's Peak]] where they were tasked with guarding the Prodigy.

For a long time, the nation of [[Novum Optimus]] took concern in losing one of the Bearers, but with no means of finding where Xavier had gone, they were left only with the option of putting up wanted posters and hoping for the best, and even that proved futile. Many years later, [[Sintel, Keeper of Halüges|Sintel]] came across the emanating feeling of [[Draconic Magic]] from outside the barrier of Scramloria, and began to be suspicious of what lied within the random dome that had mysteriously appeared over Dragonia 32 years past. This emanating Draconic Magic was of course coming from [[Siethun]] who resided within. As a result, Sintel raised this to the other Bearers of the Egg and received permission to [[Fall of Scramloria|siege]] upon the dome barrier surrounding Scramloria to see what lies within, especially because its formation coincides with the time period Xavier had gone missing.

This of course led to the barrier weakening, allowing Sintel to slip in, battle Xavier, destroy the Tower of the Eternal Eclipse, cause mass panic, create bouts of [[Nightfall]], kill Siethun, reveal the hiding place of the Prodigy Child, and then inevitably die to the hands of Xavier himself. Of course, it was too late for Scramloria, and all residents of the region-save [[Gareth of Ishoria|Gareth]]-perished from a mix of the armies and Nightfall. Additionally, the entire Order of the Eclipse was slain, and Xavier died as a sacrifice when performing the rite that accomplished the [[Prodigy's Disembodiment]]. Of course, before doing so Xavier tied a small piece of his own essence to the Tower of the Eternal Eclipse's ruins.

Following the Fall of Scramloria, the Prodigy Child began to slowly gain control over the world even without a corporeal form, which was first manifested through whispering and feelings of being watched leading to the name He Who Watches being coined. This Age ends as soon as He Who Watches had gained enough power to perform the [[Probot Massacre]], thus marking the descent of the world, and the end of the Era of Prosperity.
