It is ==**204 DB**==. Many are dead as a result of the [[Probot Massacre]], and [[The Egg]] has been in use for about 176 years. The flow of [[Chaos]] is compromised and exhibits a polar nature. Due to all these facts, [[Magic]] begins to falter. [[Prodigy Child (Probot)|He Who Watches]] takes advantage of this fact, playing with those that survived his massacre. He banishes the remaining [[Bearer of the Egg|Bearers of the Egg]] to [[Deisomnia]] and fuses back together The Egg as a way to lure people. With the promise of great power were one to obtain The Egg, He Who Watches began to gain excitement from watching people fight over it and compete for resources, technology, land, and artifacts. Examples of how the entire world was now aware of The Egg can be seen with groups of [[Humans]] that partook in the actions of things like the [[1st SMP]] and [[2nd SMP]]. Those examples didn't go too crazy, so He Who Watches will not have cared, but there were also cases where people really fell for his game and became his source of entertainment. One example of this is the events of the [[3rd SMP]]. After around 16 years of He Who Watches playing this game however, [[Gareth of Ishoria]] would return to the [[Scramloria (The Sunless Realm)|ruins of Scramloria]] and his activity would bring about [[His Weakening]]. In this period of time, He Who Watches gets angry and tries to find Gareth, but finds his efforts barred due to a mysterious power coming from the destroyed [[Tower of the Eternal Eclipse]]. This force, of course, was the spirit of [[Xavier]] that he had tied to the ruined landmark before dying. In the mean time, Magic starts to come back somewhat as it has been sometime since The Egg was used in its fractured form to abuse its power, though it is still much weaker than it once was. During this time, the [[4th SMP]] would also take place. With He Who Watches now at his weakest, he begins to get desperate, and starts to make small influences all over the world in hopes of creating [[Followers of He|zealots]] ambitious enough to come and boost his power either through some form of [[Oath]] or by stopping Gareth.

It is at this point that the story of the final SMP will take place.
