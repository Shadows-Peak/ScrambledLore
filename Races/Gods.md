Gods are a unique and complex form of [[Constructs#Chaos Constructs|Chaos Construct]] that are governed into very specific use cases of their [[Chaos]] lest they die in a process called [[Gods#Erosion of Will|Erosion of Will]].

The Gods were originally made by, and often expanded upon by, [[Legyre, The Storyteller|Legyre]]. He made them intending for specific roles to be assumed in order to disrupt the natural order of things. 

## Erosion of Will
When a God goes against their purpose and design that either Legyre gave them or that they were born to possess, then they explode outwards as their Chaos energy can no longer bind itself to the adherences it was given and an effect tied to what they governed scars the surrounding area. Their conscience is destroyed in this process, and they can only be brought back by Legyre.
