An [[Alchemy|alchemical]] creature forged as a synthetic life-form. They are not necessarily always aware of this fact that they have been made, as memories are able to be forged upon their birth. Homunculi typically struggle with having a properly formed [[Affinity]] as the process with which the homunculus was brought into being is different from a typical creature's birth. As such, [[Magic#Vessel-Bound Magic|apparatuses]] are typically used to allow such creatures access to magic. Otherwise, homunculi can often be gifted with greater strength allowing them a chance in combat even without explicit access to magic. It should be noted that homunculi do not typically possess a [[Soul]] unless otherwise fused with them, such as the practice of trying to revive someone through creating them a new body.
