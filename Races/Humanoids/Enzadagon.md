In [[Dragon Tongue]]: “Enzada” - Worshipper, “Gon” - Warrior. So it’s a worshipping warrior of the [[Dragons|dragons]]..

The Enzadagon were extremely early predecessors to humanoids races, marking the beginning of higher level thought being achievable by non dragon or [[Soul|soul]]-form creatures.

Enzadagon had an incredibly high intellect that was cultivated by a number of dragons throughout the time they roamed the [[Navu#Zalde Strip|Zalde Strip]] (Medrum was in accessible due to the water barrier). Perhaps the greatest show of this intellect and support was the creation, alongside the help of some dragons, of the [[Ul Vikel Ebragi]].
