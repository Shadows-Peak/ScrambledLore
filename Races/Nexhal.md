**“Devourers of Chaos”**

Singular: nexhe
Plural: Nexhal
Can relay information to other Nexhal they’ve met.

Nexhal are serpent-like translucent space dwellers. They are born through the death of a [[Dragons|Dragon]] that then does not get reborn (as Dragons are not under the jurisdiction of [[Surturins]], and have also existed long before its creation) and so the mind decays and the [[Concepts/Soul|Soul]] erodes its seamless hold on the [[Magics/Magic|Magic]] of the deceased Dragon, thus creating the ethereal form of a Nexhal.

Nexhal have long worm-like bodies that can be seen through and have legs that are formed of two parts and make right angles at their joint (much like how a mantis holds its arms up) that run along the bottom of the creature like a centipede. These legs allow them to walk along [[Chaos]] and or the strands of Magic. This means that, though they typically inhabit the zero-gravity realm of space, they still have full movement and within even expending Magic.

Nexhal exclusively eat Chaos in order to sustain themselves, and they prefer to travel in packs if possible. They will also attack any and all creatures that aren’t Dragons in the attempt to convert their forms into raw Chaos. The only way to kill a Nexhal is by disrupting the soul that contains its entire existence. Nexhal are the grotesque and unintended consequence of [[Yeva, the Stable Dragon|Yeva’s]] wish to allow her peers to have hastier recoveries from death.
